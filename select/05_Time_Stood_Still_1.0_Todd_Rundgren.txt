Walkin' along the sea and thinkin'
Deep in a reverie I'm sinkin'
Blind to the world, to myself I'm talkin'
Schemin' and dreamin', and sleepwalkin'

Dreamin' of colors, dreamin' of sounds
Dreamin' of things that can't be wrote down
Slippin' away so no one will miss me
Waitin' for angels to kiss me and bliss me

Time stood still
And nobody knew but me and you

What's the meaning of all that I've seen
All those images up on the screen?
Which is the channel that's goin' to show me
Answers to questions I don't even know?

This is the light I stand in the glare of
I'm here and I'm there but I'm always aware of
Singin' a song in the back of my mind
Something mysterious, something divine

How many hours, I hear you breathing?
How many days, I smell your skin?
How many years, I watch the ceiling?
How many times, the fog comes rollin' in?

This is the light I stand in the glare of
I'm here and I'm there but I'm always aware of
Singin' the song in the back of my mind
Something mysterious, something divine

Time stood still
And nobody knew but you and I
