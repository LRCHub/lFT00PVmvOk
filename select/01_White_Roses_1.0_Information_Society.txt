Do you feel small
Do you feel like nothing
Do you feel like you're wasting your time

Can you stand sunlight
Do you feel too much
How will you know where you're broken

But you know that the fear you feel
Comes back this time each day
And you know if you live a thousand years in silence
You will still feel this way

Can you see home
Can you see tomorrow
Can you see the sun anymore

Do you walk the world
Waiting to be discovered
Do you want what he said
You can never have

And you know that her tears were taken
And cooked up for the queen
But you will never find her now
She's gone and her trail is far to clean

And every single moment feels like everything is wrong
And everything around you says that this's not your home
And everybody else just seems to be already there
And you can't get from here to there
Without some sort of help you've never seen

It's white roses
It's a spinning sky
It's a field with the sun in your eyes

And do you ask yourself for help
To get you through the day
And when you're on the street you find
The world is moving away
Spend all day under water
Spend all night curled in a ball
And when you're all alone what reason
Can you see for trying at all
